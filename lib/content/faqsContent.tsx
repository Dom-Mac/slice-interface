          <b>
            Slicers are smart contracts which represent a specific entity,
            project or asset
          </b>{" "}
          (anything really). They are made up of one or more slices, and their
          main purpose is to <b>split any ETH they receive</b> to the owner of
          those slices.

    answer: (

        <p>
          Slicers are ideal to split payments between multiple owners, or to
          represent anything that needs to have an objective value. Each slicer
          also comes with a{" "}

        <p>Generally you may want to either:</p>

            Create a slicer for your own entity, project or asset â€“ and

    question: "What is a superowner?",
    answer: (

        <p>
          Anyone holding at least the minimum amount of slices (specified during
          the creation of the slicer) is a superowner.
        </p>
        <p>Superowners have privileged access to a slicer, allowing them to:</p>

          <li>Edit the name, description, image (and other metadata)</li>
          <li>Add new products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is up to the slicer creator to decide how many can eventually
          become superowners, by setting the <i>minimum slices</i> amount. The
          lower it is, the higher the number of potential superowners.

        <p>
          Each slicers comes with a <b>decentralized store</b> from where you
          can sell products. All ETH earned end up to the slicer, which can then
          be claimed by its owners.
        </p>
        <p>Products are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Immutable</b>: their content is saved on the public IPFS network
            using Filecoin, through{" "}

    question: "What are sponsorships?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Whenever someone sends ETH to a slicer without buying a product, it
          counts as a sponsorship. The 10 top sponsors will appear on the slicer
          page and are able to <b>customize their space by adding a link</b> to
          redirect users that click on their address/ENSname.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can send ETH for a sponsorship through a standard ETH transaction
          to the slicer address, or by using the apposite form in the{" "}
          <i>sponsorships</i> section of its page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Sponsorships may be handled differently in the future and may
          give access to more advantages over time.

          Yes. Slices are ERC1155, semi-fungible tokens. By specifying 2 or more

    question: "What's the point of Slice?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Originally, the aim of this project was to conceive a special kind of
          NFTs whose value could be estimated using objective, public data. This
          would allow their use in many real-world applications, where a
          parallel to their actual value is required.
        </p>
        <p>
          With slicers, this objective value is the income they generate. By
          knowing how much ETH a slicer has generated, it is possible to
          establish a base value for its slices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea then gradually evolved into its current form, where slicers
          can also act as decentralized stores. Products are what will
          ultimately enable the use of slicers in several different ways.

    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: (

        <p>
          Slice is and will remain entirely <b>free to use</b>, you only have to
          pay the blockchain transaction fee to interact with slicers. This
          website is essentially a way to interact with Slice&apos;s smart
          contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a slicer receives a payment (either selling a product or
          through sponsorships) it automatically gives a 2.5% protocol fee to
          Slice. This fee is used to improve the services surrounding slicers
          and keep adding new features to the ecosystem.
