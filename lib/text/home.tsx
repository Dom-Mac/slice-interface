      An autonomous being on the Ethereum blockchain (smart contract) capable of
      transparently distributing its ETH to its owners, proportionally to their

      Since it&apos;s a special kind of{" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="fractionable-NFT" size="text-normal" />,
      you&apos;re free to transfer/sell your slices however you prefer (even on

      {" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="NFTs" size="text-normal" /> at their full
      potential
    </h1>
    <p>
      NFTs are cool because they are unique, so they can digitally represent any
      real or virtual asset, service or product. However, they&apos;re used
      mainly for collecting purposes as it&apos;s hard to make them useful in
      real world applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slicers ownership is linked to their value so they are able to{" "}
      <DoubleText
        inactive
        logoText="truly represent anything"
        size="text-normal"
      />
      . Freely exchangeable slices, privileged access to restricted operations,
      upgradeability and many more features to come.

    <h1 className="!mb-2">What are slicers for?</h1>
    <p>
      For now slicers can be used to collect payments for a project or product,
      and automatically split them between its owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is{" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="so much more" size="text-normal" /> coming
      soon. Slicers will turn into an independent payment infrastructure for
      your project, company, product, service or whatever.
    </p>
  </>
)

export const section4 = (
  <>
    <h1 className="!mb-2">
      Decentralized & <DoubleText inactive logoText="Free" size="text-normal" />
    </h1>
    <p>
      Slicers are completely free to use, except for the blockchain transaction
      fees. There is just a tiny 2.5% fee which is automatically withheld to any
      payment made to the slicer, which will be used to improve our services
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a reward for using slicers, you will receive{" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="SLC tokens" size="text-normal" /> (ERC20)
      whenever you release ETH from a slicer, which can be used to unlock
      services from Slice in the future.
