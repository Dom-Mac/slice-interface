    </h1>
    <p>
      NFTs are cool because they are unique, so they can digitally represent any
      real or virtual asset, service or product. However, they&apos;re still
      mainly used for collecting purposes as it&apos;s hard to leverage their
      distinctive characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slicers ownership is linked to their value, making it possible to open a
      new branch of applications and allow them to{" "}
      <DoubleText
        inactive
        logoText="truly represent anything"
        size="text-normal"

    <p>
      Slicers can now be used to collect payments for yourself, a project or
      product, and automatically split them between its owners. It&apos;s a{" "}
      <DoubleText
        inactive
        logoText="transferable slice of ownership"
        size="text-normal"
      />{" "}
      which also includes any revenue generated from a slicer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is so much more coming. Slicers will soon turn into an
      independent{" "}
      <DoubleText
        inactive
        logoText="payments infrastructure"
        size="text-normal"

    </h1>
    <p>
      Slicers live on the blockchain, so when you create one it&apos;s really
      yours. Our infrastructure is also entirely{" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="free to use" size="text-normal" />, we just
      take a 2.5% fee from payments to slicers, which will be used to improve
      them over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, when you release ETH from a slicer you receive{" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="SLC tokens" size="text-normal" /> (ERC20)
      which can be used to unlock perks and services in the future.
