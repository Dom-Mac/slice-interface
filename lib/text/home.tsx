      An autonomous being on the Ethereum blockchain (smart contract) capable of

      {" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="NFTs" size="text-normal" /> at their full
      potential
    </h1>
    <p>
      NFTs are cool because they are unique, so they can digitally represent any
      real or virtual asset, service or product. However, they&apos;re used
      mainly for collecting purposes as it&apos;s hard to make them useful in
      real world applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slicers ownership is linked to their value so they are able to{" "}
      <DoubleText
        inactive
        logoText="truly represent anything"
        size="text-normal"

      features to come.

    <h1 className="!mb-2">What are slicers for?</h1>
    <p>
      For now slicers can be used to collect payments for a project or product,
      and automatically split them between its owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is so much more coming soon. Slicers will turn into an
      independent{" "}
      <DoubleText
        inactive
        logoText="payments infrastructure"
        size="text-normal"
      />{" "}
      for your project, company, product, service or whatever.
    </p>
  </>
)

export const section4 = (
  <>
    <h1 className="!mb-2">
      Truly <DoubleText inactive logoText="Decentralized" size="text-normal" />
    </h1>
    <p>
      All slicers and our infrastructure are entirely free to use, except for
      the blockchain transaction fees. We only take a 2.5% fee from payments to
      slicers, which will be used to improve them over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you release ETH from a slicer you will receive{" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="SLC tokens" size="text-normal" /> (ERC20)
      which can be used to unlock services from Slice in the future.
