      The cool thing about slicers is they can be used to represent any entity,
      project or digital asset. They generate revenue and split it among all
      their owners.

      (fractional NFTs) that represent ownership of a slicer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They&apos;re ERC1155 tokens so you&apos;re free to transfer or sell your
      slices however you prefer (even on{" "}
      <a href="https://opensea.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

      In addition to all its features, slicers can have their own{" "}
      <DoubleText inactive logoText="products" size="text-normal" /> and sell
      them from their main page. Think of it like a{" "}
      <b>decentralized online store that can sell anything</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best part is that this is all decentralized, and product data are
      encrypted in such a way that only those who buy them can see their
      content.

      The ETH income generated by slicers is publicly available, which make
      slices <b>the first tradable NFTs with an objective value</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opens up to many exciting use cases, with slicers acting as an{" "}
      <b>independent, decentralized payments infrastructure</b> and counterpart
      to many real-world applications.

      However there is no right way or limit to how slicers can be used, so feel
