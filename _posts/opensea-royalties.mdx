Slicers are the building blocks of the Slice platform. They can do a bunch of things, but mainly they're **smart contracts which split any ETH received to their owners, proportionally to the amount of owned slices**.

By setting the slicer address as the payout address for your NFT collection, all ETH received will be split among the slicer owners.

## 1. Create a slicer

Head to [this page](http://localhost:3000/slice) to create a new slicer.

![Slicer creation page](http://localhost:3000/blog/opensea-royalties-1.jpg)

Select the addresses who will receive the royalties and the amount of **slices** in their possession. In this case, each owner will equally split any ETH received by the slicer.

Let's dive into it.

> Slices are ERC1155 tokens so they can be transferred or sold on Opensea like any other token.

**Superowner slices**: represent the amount of slices that a user needs to own to edit Slicer metadata, add products on the decentralized store and other admin-level actions. Pick any amount that is convenient for you.

**Collectible asset**: If active, the slicer's metadata cannot be changed once set for the first time, useful for slicers that need to represent NFTs. You can leave this unchecked.

Now click on **Slice** and wait for the transaction to go through. If it takes time you can leave this page and find it later in your [profile page](https://slice.so/profile).

## 2. Find the slicer address

Once the slicer is created, head to its page to find its address (you can also find it directly on your profile page). **Click on it to copy it**

Optionally, you can set the slicer metadata to customize it (it won't cost transaction fees).

## 3. Set the slicer address as the payout address for your NFT collection

Head to your collection page on Opensea, connect with the address that owns it and click to the **Edit** button.

In the **royalties** section, look for the **Payout wallet address** and set your slicer address there.

And that's it! ðŸ¥³

## 4. Redeem ETH from the slicer

Once your slicer receives some ETH, as an owner you can redeem what is own to you from your [profile page](https://slice.so/profile).

Click **Trigger release**, and once the transaction goes through you will find the ETH and some complimentary **SLC utility tokens** in your wallet.

Sweet right?
