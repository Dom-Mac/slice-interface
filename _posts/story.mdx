Slice was born out of an experiment to create a **NFT with an objective value**. The idea was that such a token would theoretically be able to represent a new class of digital assets, including most real world assets.

Usually assets are valued based on the revenue they generate, so I figured that the value of a NFT could be related to the amount of ETH it "receives". NFTs can't directly receive ETH so I had to create apposite smart contracts to make it work.

Sometime later I started thinking about the value of **community ownership and asset fractionalization**, getting excited at all the application these concepts combined would enable — most notably NFT-based payment splitting and transferable royalties.

> That's where the term **slicer** comes from (the being who splits payments into slices) and how slices (ERC1155 Semi-Fungible Tokens, representing the **slice of ownership** over a slicer) came to be.

And then the damned thought — what if slicers could actually sell stuff? Why not turn them into **independent, fully decentralized stores**? Is that even possible?

**Imagine if you could sell anything directly from the blockchain**, with everything that comes with it (such as composability, censorship resistance and immutability). Imagine if you could not only sell digital files, but services, subscriptions, and even physical goods — anything. Wouldn't that be slick (and arduous).

Fast forward months of developments, countless iterations, a few eureka moments and way too many unexpected technical challenges — Slice gradually took the shape it has today.

All these basic concepts compound to further increase the number of potential applications for slicers, which is incredibly exciting — but at the same time make it hard for people to actually understand them as they're quite different than anything else in this space.

So far this was done to satisfy my own curiosity, but now that the platform and contracts are in place it's time to take it to the next stage. Slice should now take a path that allows it to stand on its own, **gradually decentralizing itself and becoming a DAO**. This process will take time but it is undoubtedly the most suitable way for Slice to fulfill its purpose.

> Slice mission is to build an open-source, composable, decentralised payments infrastructure for teams, projects and communities.

I strongly believe in a future where **DAOs become the norm for decentralized projects**, especially due to the game-changing governance and contribution mechanics. [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) is a testament to this, both with the first-class management of their DAO and with how they showed how easily DAOs can fund themselves and manage their treasury. You just love to see it.

In the near future, Slice will strive to:

- enhance composability with other smart contracts
- evolve product stores to also allow for services and physical goods (through Slice API)
- introduce new slicer features (such as accept ERC20 as payments or allow them to own NFTs)
- create a dedicated marketplace for slices
- explore viable L2 solutions

In the long term, the plan is for Slice to build new products upon the existing platform, constantly pushing the limits of the metaverse while building its own ecosystem.
